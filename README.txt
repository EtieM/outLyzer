INTRODUCTION
------------

OutLyzer is a variant-caller conceived for low allele-ratio mutations
detection, based on sequencing background noise evaluation. It evaluates if
the mutation is significantly different from background noise, using modified
Thompson tau technique.
This program was conceived in the Department of Cancer Biology and Genetics,
Francois Baclesse Cancer Center, Caen, France 
Program can be downloaded at: http://github.com/EtieM/outLyzer


REQUIREMENTS
------------
- Linux OS
- Python v2.7
- Python librairies: subprocess / numpy / scipy / argparse / multiprocessing
- Samtools v1.2 or v1.3


INSTALLATION
------------

Before launching outLyzer program, it is preferable to set Samtools path as an environment variable:
- For one session: $export samtools=/path/to/samtools
- Permanantly: write previous command line in .bashrc file

Otherwise complete Samtools path must be indicated in outLyzer launching command line.



UTILISATION
-----------
outLyzer has 2 main operating modes:

- calling mode: $python outLyzer.py calling -bed regionFile.bed -ref referenceFile.fa -bam fileToAnalyse.bam -output /path/to/resultDir/[-arguments]
				This mode works as a standard variant-caller and analyse a whole BAM file to highlight mutations, compiled in a VCF file.

				optional arguments:
				  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
				  -samtools SAMTOOLS    Complete Samtools path if not specified in environment
										variable
				  -pythonPath PYTHONPATH
										Complete python path if different from default python
										version
				  -core CORE            define number of cores used to process analysis [1]
				  -cut CUT              defines into how many parts bed file is divide [3]
				  -bed BED              bed file required for analysis [REQUIRED]
				  -bam BAM              bam File to analyze [REQUIRED]
				  -ref REF              faidx indexed reference sequence file (fasta)
										[REQUIRED]
				  -output OUTPUT        output Path To write results [REQUIRED]
				  -t T                  Student t value used in modified Thompson tau
										technique [0.001]
				  -bal BAL              minimum Forward / Reverse read proportion [0.3]
				  -Q Q                  minimum average Phred Score to be considered as a real
										mutation (only relevant for SNP) [20]
				  -SDQ SDQ              maximum Standard deviation authorized for average
										Phred Score [7]
				  -WS WS                Window Size: region (number of bp) around the mutation
										on which background noise have to be determined [200]
				  -WSmin WSMIN          Window Size Minimum Size: minimum region size (number
										of bp) required for analysis [10]
				  -x X                  Multiplicative factor that specifies how often the
										mutation must be above background noise [2]
				  -AS                   Analysis sensitivity: Returns an additional file
										containing analysis average sensitivity for each line
										of bed file
				  -FRcor                Forward Reverse Correction: take into account any
										imbalance in the Forward-Reverse reads distribution in
										the Forward / Reverse alternative Read Proportion
										(-bal option)
				  -HSM HSM              HotSpot Metrics: Produce sensitivity Threshold for
										HotSpot positions, in an additional file. Requires
										formated HotSpot File in argument (see documentation
										for more details).
				  -verbose VERBOSE      If verbose mode is set to 1, details analysis process
										steps [0]

				
				Precisions for HSM option:
				/!\ File required for HotSpot Metrics must be formatted as follows:
				
				chrN	startPosition	Annotation
				
				Each column must be separated by a tabulation, and annotation column must be present.
				ex: chr12	25398284	KRAS_codon12
				
				
				It will return a tabulated file containing for each position a local estimation of sensitivity, displayed as a percentage.
